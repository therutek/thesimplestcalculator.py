# thesimplestcalculator.py
My first Python file and first steps with Python.
That is the files where I'm learning Python.
Creating code in VSCode right now.
4 files, two are in polish language and other two in english language.
! I just found out there is a easier way to create calculator. Here are files called "calculatorek" and "kalkulatorek". These are final files and done calculators.
End of the project.
